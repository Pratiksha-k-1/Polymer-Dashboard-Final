Setting presets to: medium_quality

Fitting with arguments:
{'enable_ensemble': True,
 'eval_metric': MASE,
 'freq': 'W-FRI',
 'hyperparameters': 'light',
 'known_covariates_names': [],
 'num_val_windows': 1,
 'prediction_length': 6,
 'quantile_levels': [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9],

 'refit_every_n_windows': 1,
 'refit_full': False,
 'skip_model_selection': False,
 'target': 'target',
 'time_limit': 60,
 'verbosity': 2}

Provided train_data has 83 rows, 1 time series. Median time series length is 83 (min=83, max=83). 

Provided data contains following columns:
	target: 'target'

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'MASE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
